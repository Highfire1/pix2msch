# pix2msch
A program that converts images into Mindustry schematics

The usage should be pretty self explainatory once you open gui.py

Note: You will need `pyperclip` and `pillow` to run pix2msch. You can install them by doing `pip <package>`

WARNING: Images above 100x100 don't actually seem large, but when converted to a Mindustry schematic, it's actually huge, so I reccomend to keep images below 100x100
