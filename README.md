# pix2msch
A program that converts images into Mindustry schematics

The usage should be pretty self explainatory once you open gui.py

Note: The only external package you'll need is `pillow`, and you can install it by doing `pip install pillow`

WARNING: Images above 100x100 don't actually seem large, but when converted to a Mindustry schematic, it's actually huge, so I reccomend to keep images below 100x100
